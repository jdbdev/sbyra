Shediac Bay Yacht Racing Association (SBYRA) documentation

SBYRA is a single user application as part of a larger application in development. 

1. Basic Implementation: 

- App allows users to register their yachts for the local racing club and events. Admin staff can create regatta events and event groups to track all racing data and results. 
- Weather app connects to an API to display and register weather data at various current and event times.
- Main web interface allows users and non-users to view event results and browse public yatch and event info.

2. Future additions:

- Local chat feature
- Local buy & sell feature
